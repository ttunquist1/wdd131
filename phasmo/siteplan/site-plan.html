			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p>I am basing my website off of an existing page. I will be improing it.</p>
			<img src="example.png" alt="the website im improving" width="500px">
			<p>Here is the page on mobile, the reason I want to impove the website</p>
			<img src="mobile.png" alt="The same website, but on mobile. Clunky page, too many pop ups so you press the wrong thing a lot." width="300px">
			<h3>[Page 2]</h3>
			<p>Each Ghost has special behaviors that can be used to figure out its type without any evidences. Instead of displaying each behavior in the boxs on the main page, I  will redirect the user to a page about the perticular ghost.</p>
			<h3>[Page 3]</h3>
			<p>I will also have a 3rd page about each map, and the location of each item on each map.</p>
